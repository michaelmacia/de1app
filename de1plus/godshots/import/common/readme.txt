Put "EEX format" (espresso exchange) espresso trace files here, and they will be imported directly into "godshots" when the DE1+ tablet app is launched.

You can import trace files from Smart Espresso Profiler https://www.naked-portafilter.com/smart-espresso-profiler/

Contact us if you'd like more information about the EEX format.  It's our intention for it to be open to all.
